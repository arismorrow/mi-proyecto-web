## Project Concept

### What are you building?

I am developing my first **portfolio web app**, a personal digital space designed to showcase my growth as a web designer and developer. The site will merge aesthetics, interactivity, and clean code, following best practices in accessibility and responsive design.

### Who is it for?

This project is primarily aimed at the **course instructor and teaching team**, but it will also serve as a professional showcase for **recruiters, collaborators, and future clients** interested in my creative and technical approach.

### Why does it matter?

This project embodies the principles of the course: incremental development, transparent documentation through commits, and ethical digital creation. It marks my transition from student to digital creator, where every line of code contributes to a functional, accessible, and visually refined portfolio.

## Content Strategy

### Key Sections / Pages

1. **Home** — Introduction and call to action.  
2. **Portfolio** — Gallery of projects with optimized visuals.  
3. **About Me** — Biography, education, and design philosophy.  
4. **Contact** — Form or professional links.

### Content Sources

The content will come from my own academic work and class documentation, complemented by original text and multimedia resources optimized through ImageKit.io.

### Multilingual Considerations

- Primary language: English 🇬🇧  
- Secondary language: Spanish 🇪🇸  
- Translation strategy: Manual translation adapted for professional context, ensuring tone consistency and cultural relevance.

## Design Direction

### Visual Style

A **minimalist, editorial-inspired** aesthetic focusing on clarity, whitespace, and hierarchy. The interface will reflect a balance between creativity and technical precision.

### Color Palette

- **Pure White (#FFFFFF)** — text & spacing  
- **Medium Gray (#888888)** — secondary elements  
- **Accent Blue (#007AFF)** — interactive highlights

### Typography

- **Headings:** `Poppins` — geometric and modern sans-serif  
- **Body text:** `Inter` — readable and optimized for screens  
- Scalable system using relative units (`rem`, `clamp()`).
